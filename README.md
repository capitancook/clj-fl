# Frame Language in Clojure

Frame Language (FL) is a framework developed  in the seventies to represent chunks of knowledge, see Prof. Marvin Minsky seminal paper ["A framework for representing knowledge"] (http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/Frames/frames.html). The first implementations of FL were based on Lisp. The interest about FL survived to all the "fashions of the moment" of the last four decades of AI research. It is actively used in knowledge representation for semantic Web. Even Clojure has been clearly and strongly influenced by this paradigm.

This library is an attempt to bring in the Clojure ecosystem the simple and clear  Lisp formalization of the Frame Language introduced by Prof. Winston, in his great book  ["Lisp"]() .

At the moment (20141112) this library is a pre alfa software.
